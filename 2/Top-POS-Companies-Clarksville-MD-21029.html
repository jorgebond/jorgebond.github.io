<p>Nowadays point of sale bar code scanners are an absolute necessity in any retail business. Its built-in marketing tools enable you to deliver the right content, product and offer to your customers at the right time. ECR Software's Catapult is a unified POS platform for grocery stores, supermarkets, convenience stores, pharmacies, and specialty food and beverage stores.

<p>With the bar tab feature, pre-authorize credit cards so collecting payment is a breeze, and feel at ease because you won't be responsible for a stack of credit cards sitting behind the bar any longer. Likewise, gift and loyalty programs—whether for retail or hospitality customers —can turn payment into a personalized guest experience in which you reward customers, run targeted promotions, and gather key data on preferences and behaviors.</p>
<h2>What POS Products Do You Really Need Clarksville</h2>

<p>But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. It takes the payment of the customers by adding up the totals along with the sales tax. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to. Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>

Menu management lets you switch between different menus for different parts of the day, such as happy hour. Usually, this is an automated process which is scheduled to run at a certain time interval in real stores.</p>

Restaurants will get the flexibility of changing the menu , menu style, and other menu options as per the need and requirement without any additional cost. IPOS plays an important role to improve sales processes, operational efficiencies, reporting accuracy and internal communications, and identify opportunities for cost reduction.</p>
