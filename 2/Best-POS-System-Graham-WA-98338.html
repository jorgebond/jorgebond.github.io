Interactive graphs help managers understand the data collected in the software system's reporting and analytics features. Those are all available features in POS systems. The next consideration is an inventory management system, since keeping control of stock is a time-consuming job.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well. Retail merchants, for example, can operate with an internet-enabled device, terminal stand, credit card reader, receipt printer, and cash drawer. Once again, here's our quick look at the three POS services that rise above the rest when it comes to features, support, and pricing.
