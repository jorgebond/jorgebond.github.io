<p>It can be challenging to find the right Point of Sale software system for your business. Your point of sale system should be able to manage your customer base, keep up with their buying habits, how often they visit, when was their last visit and what special occasions they have coming up. Your point of sale system then should be able to sort these into groups that should be sent mailers, coupons, invitations to special events or simply told that they are appreciated and asked to visit you again.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>

<p>Salesforce Commerce Cloud also gives you the kind of support provided by the massive Salesforce ecosystem, paving an easy path to globalize your operations with full support for local languages and currencies.

<p>Industry experts recommend buying POS hardware; leases often come with lengthy, noncancelable contracts and specific card processing requirements that cost you more money over time. Thus, every restaurateur must look for the below-mentioned features when choosing a reliable restaurant management software to manage operations, employees and in turn, increase sales. Most POS systems for bars and restaurants will have this feature.</p>
<p>The Square Stand transforms an iPad into a simple cash register, and businesses can purchase additional hardware to customize their setup.
