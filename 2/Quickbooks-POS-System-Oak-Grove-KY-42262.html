Common POS systems include a computer, receipt printer, lockable cash drawer, a scanner to read the bar code, a magnetic swipe reader and a modem and pole display. POS software companies can be found right online with just a simple search, and you will even find open source POS software, but again I suggest that you stay far away from it.
