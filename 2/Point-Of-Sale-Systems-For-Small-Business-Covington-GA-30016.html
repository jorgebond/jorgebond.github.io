POS vendors and retailers are working hard to standardise the technology behind POS systems, to drive down manufacturing and product costs. With open API's, these POS systems can allow integration platforms like DBSync to share the data with various other apps securely, thus avoiding double data entry. From taking orders in a coffee shop, booking hotel rooms, selling event tickets, retail stores, or restaurants.</p>
