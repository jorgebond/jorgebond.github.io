<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>While considered a Point of Sale system, Lightspeed Restaurant POS is much more. It is interesting because you get a feel of sitting in a store and executing your test cases since POS requires setup as you would see in any stores. This all-inclusive system is a platform for staff management, inventory control, back office management, reporting, and marketing. Now how the software works is that every time an item is scanned it will be deducted from the inventory database.</p>
