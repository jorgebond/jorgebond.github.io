<p>Like their printer counterpart an all-in-one POS system combines multiple technologies and integrates them into one housing to maximize value plus convenience to the end user. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
<h2>Choosing The Best Point Of Sale System For Your Restaurant Burlingame</h2>

If you have an aging cash register or point of purchase system and would like a new modern retail or restaurant POS system that's both affordable and easy to use, then we would love to talk to you.</p>
<p>A POS terminal is the device that the mobile POS software runs on. Their interface allows you to present detailed menu options with photos, descriptions, and prices so new staff can familiarize themselves with the food in a flash.

<h2>Top POS Software Burlingame CA</h2>
<p>Lightspeed is a great choice if you need to manage sales, inventory, and staff across multiple locations. This allows you to elevate customer service and improve turnaround time when customer orders are quickly entered front of house and immediately available to back of house for processing. Finding the company that charges the least for credit card transactions is key, but you may also need a system that can accept cash or be willing to take your business cashless.</p>
<p>But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. It takes the payment of the customers by adding up the totals along with the sales tax. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to. Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>
<p>No matter what the size of your business, keeping track of what items enter and leave you store's inventory is an important part of running an efficient business. Multi-Platform Support - While web-based SaaS is the way to go now, the best POS systems for restaurants are not restricted to online PC dashboards. So, it is for restaurant owners and managers to understand their requirements before opting for what they consider an ‘ideal restaurant management software' for their business.</p>
