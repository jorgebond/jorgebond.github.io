<p>Mobile-enabled and cloud-based omnichannel platform to speed up innovation and business change for midsize to large retail and restaurant businesses. Cash management is a significant feature of POS software systems, but there are other key functions. For smaller retail businesses, we recommend our new retail POS solution, Harbortouch Checkout HT Retail is designed for larger business environments like department stores, grocery stores, bookstores, beer distributors, or stores with over 10,000 SKUs. You can use them to monitor your business performance, cash flows, employee activities, order processing, inventory levels, and much more in real-time.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>

An optimized POS system will help your bar or nightclub — streamlining operations, better understanding customers, and allowing staff to provide the best possible service to all of your guests.</p>
<p>The point of sale system can be integrated with your other systems and software such as eCommerce platforms, accounting apps, ERP and warehouse systems. Splitting the bill across multiple credit cards is a common occurrence at restaurants and bars. Loyalty: Loyalty can be a great way to increase profits for your business by giving customers a reason to frequent your store again. From desktop to mobile POS to self-service, Intel® processors and technologies power the point of sale and deliver hardware-enhanced security to help encrypt and protect data.</p>
<p>A reliable restaurant POS system is the difference between a coffee shop or bar that feels like a disorganized open market, and one where customers enjoy the convenience of ordering remotely from their mobile phones, or perhaps booking tables beforehand and then having their orders delivered right on time. Manage your sales, loyalty program and inventory from a smartphone or tablet. Any store that has a point of sale and point of purchase can use POS software.</p>

If you at some point decide to include more stores or an online store to your solution, we can expand it easily.

<p>Zomato helps food establishments fully organize restaurant procedures and systems. Table service and fly-by service order entry, cashier financial accountability, and staff communications. With NCR Aloha, you'll lower the time and cost to train your staff, so they can spend less time focused on the technology and spend more time focused on delighting your customers. Store Managers mainly require such systems to track products through each stage of the inventory cycle and also to have an idea before an item falls below the stock level.</p>
<p>This is why I recommend taking your time and assessing the various people you will rely on to make the software work for your business. From POS to sales reporting and analytics, it's the best restaurant POS management system available. If you are keeping the pizza delivery part of your business while also running the pizza restaurant, these features will be in addition to the "must have" features from the previous paragraph.</p>
