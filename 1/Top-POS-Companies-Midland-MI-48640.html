Whether you're planning to get into this exciting industry or are already in it, understand that competition is stiff and almost always, between two restaurants with an equally successful menu, how efficient you provide customer service is the deal-breaker. Giving loyal customers premier access to promotions and special in-store VIP events is a great way to show them some love.</p>
