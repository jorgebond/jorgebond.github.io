<p>When choosing the right retail point-of-sale system (POS) for your business, it is essential to understand what type of system will best meet your needs. Over the last few months they have shifted their company from a small business to a corporation that does not care about their individual customers. The common database that serves this network must also be capable of serving many concurrent users - cashier, customers, kitchen and perhaps even a drink bar. With the diverse needs of different food establishments, no POS software is a fit-all solution. It also has a user-friendly mobile app, Revel Insights, which allows for sales analysis in real-time.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can monitor the sales made by your servers and manage security permissions on the POS. With POS Software you will be able to capture complete transaction details at the point of sale, and transaction history and real-time database records are stored indefinitely so your data is always available for reporting and analysis. Mobile point of sale systems that utilize handheld tablets eliminate the clunky technology that typically stands between staff and guests.</p>

<p>Some POS software has built-in payment processing while others work with third-party integration. With some retail systems, you can buy your own computers and then buy the POS software for your business separately. DBSync , a pioneer in the field, allows for seamless integration, providing complete control over the business and optimizing sales. This feature helps protect a bar business from running out of product, which can be one of the most damaging forces to an exceptional customer experience.</p>
<p>But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. It takes the payment of the customers by adding up the totals along with the sales tax. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to. Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>
<p>You avoid entering the same data twice as all sales are automatically registered in the accounts. The price, lower than most POS software services in the restaurant business, is also a big selling point. We customized the user interface to include fields for the exact data we need to sell online - things like name, subname, item, weight, dimensions, UPC, and at least three photos which we get from our wholesalers.</p>
