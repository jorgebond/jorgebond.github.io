<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>Some point of sale systems will go a step further—they'll allow you to make inventory orders within their software. As any bar manager or beverage director knows, bar inventory management is the beating heart of a well-run, profitable bar. The specialized POS design lets you keep watch and track employees, edit menus and track inventory. TouchBistro features a good mix of bar-specific features that help you manage catering, reservations, and deliveries.</p>

Connect with your customers: for those of you using a Yelp business user account, connect with all your customers and get their reviews to improve your business. Another factor that determines how much you'll pay for hardware is whether you use a legacy terminal or a mobile POS system. A right POS should also keep track of inventory at other branches and provide continuous insights on product sales.</p>
<p>The OrderUp Self-Order Kiosk app is designed to increase ticket size by at least 20% at table and counter service restaurants. Additional register features to consider for nightclub and bar point of sale software is employee management, inventory management, customer loyalty, recipes, tab management, quick reorder rounds, and quick customer checkout. Modern restaurant POS systems provide a platform that sits at the heart of any food and beverage operation, large or small, helping to enhance the customer experience and streamline business operations.</p>

Revel is a hybrid POS system that stores data in the cloud, but it also leverages a local network to sync your sales data between iPads.</p>

<p>Its restaurant-specific features include reservations, table and delivery management tools, and a kitchen display system. Mobile POS systems allow employees to mingle with your customers on the store floor, deterring shoplifting. As well as actually allowing the customer to purchase goods, POS systems allow the business operator to do nearly everything from ordering and purchasing stock to generating reports on sales.</p>
<p>POS software is the technology used in tandem with point of sale hardware—such as a card reader mounted to a smartphone—to process and monitor sales, track inventory, store customer data, integrate with systems and databases, and a variety of other functions. With Toast POS , the bartender will not need to ask the customers for their cards multiple times for the tab.
