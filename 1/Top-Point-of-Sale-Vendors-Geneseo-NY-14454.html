<p>In fact, an online presence has become so necessary that some systems, such as Shopify POS and Vend POS, include it as part of their package. When deciding on a bar POS system, it's important to talk to a representative to find out if they have all the features you need, and what they will cost—often, the starter” or core” package does not include more sophisticated features like advanced reporting, the loyalty program, or granular inventory controls.</p>
<p>Accept payments using cash and options like Apple Pay and EMV for different customer transactions. The POS system allows you to view sales reports in real-time so you can track which products are selling. The Clover technology ensures a complete security system keeping the card data of your customers safe. Customers can proceed with credit cards, cash, check, debit cards, or maybe a gift card.

<p>Tight integration between the point of sale software and the cash drawer is a must. It provides payment processing through Vantiv, and you can purchase its POS hardware either directly from the company or from Amazon. With lack of access to processed business information, retailers earlier operated on demand forecasts based on intuitions and gut feelings.
