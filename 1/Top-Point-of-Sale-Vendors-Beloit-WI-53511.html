<p>Trying to manage and grow a restaurant using old, antiquated processes like hand written order slips is a huge waste of time and energy. A credit card swipe is integrated with the POS system to quickly and accurately approve the customer's credit card and to input the transaction into the system. IVend POS is Windows OS based software that allows for a variety of peripherals and device configurations, including scanners, cash drawers, displays and EMV-compliant card readers. That's because it's the software that lets you track sales, issue receipts, and perform back-office functions.</p>
<p>Your customers can pay with credit cards, debit cards, cash, and more. However, Receipt Paper is still a must-have for any small or medium-sized business because it brings quick snapshot to customers about their purchase.

Retail Pro POS is a single, device-agnostic software that gives you robust functionality on both ePOS and mPOS - so you get integrated store data without sacrificing flexibility on the sales floor.</p>

<p>While your business may not be big enough to go this route and also you may have other reasons to keep an employee at your point of sale the fact is, that today high tech retail systems are just that simple to operate. These can be expanded and improved upon by using additional hardware, such as barcode scanners, card readers, or other software modules. Retailers also have certain functionality that should be incorporated in the POS system, spanning from an inventory library to keep track of stock levels to hardware tools like a scale on the counter (for food priced according to weight), barcode scanner and a device for taking off alarm tags of liquor bottles or clothes.</p>
