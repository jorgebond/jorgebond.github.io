<p>POS stands for "point of sale" and it is generally used to describe the computer used to check out customers. With a good (POS) point of sale system, you can keep customers loyal, and keep them spending. By nature of processing the outward flow of your business's inventory, point of sale systems—the best ones, anyway—keep track of where your inventory currently stands. When doing so, remember that you will need to invest in a server (unless the system will work with your existing one) retail software, accounting software, terminals (how many will you need?) Talking to other business owners is a good way to get an idea of the range of what's out there in terms of price.</p>
<p>Your customers become your shop's ultimate cheerleader, speaking positively about you within their social circles and essentially attracting new customers for you. Consolidate your inventory, customer, and staff management across all locations so that you can manage your entire business from one place. Reduced time for management to compute employee hours. POS systems also offer reliable add-ons and hardware systems such as barcode scanners, cash drawers, receipt printers, and card swipers.</p>

<p>We believe that restaurant point of sale and inventory management software should be mobile and affordable. Customers rate their experience alerting managers when a patron isn't satisfied with the service. Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle.

<p>A supermarket with high traffic cannot afford a systemic failure, hence each point of sale station should not only be very robust both in terms of software, database and hardware specifications but also designed in such a way as to prevent causing a systemic failure - such as may happen through the use of a single central database for operations. Let your customers shop their way with the ability to refund or exchange online purchases at any retail location.</p>
