<p>It used to be that for a small retail business, a cash register and a black-box credit card terminal were sufficient. Before the introduction of technology into the restaurants, bills were traditionally generated by merely calculating the order value manually and giving customers a handwritten receipt. The payment options offered, the speed of the transaction, and the ability to tailor the transaction to the customers' needs each have profound impacts on customer satisfaction and your overall business success. It is advisable to use your POS computer exclusively for the purpose it is meant for - recording sales transactions, generating reports and managing inventory.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
