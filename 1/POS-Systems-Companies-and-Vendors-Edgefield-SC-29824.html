<p>If you run a retail store, you know that a point of sale system is essential, especially in food retailing, where large volumes of goods go through the check out. In addition, some states (such as California) now require some kind of customer-facing screen be available so customers can view sales information as a sale is rung up. Your point of sale should help you automate and optimize how you manage your business's inventory. Give your bartenders possibility to quickly and accurately serve customers and create a unique atmosphere for your bar. So, of course, restaurants handled most of their management stuff manually.</p>
<p>Consequently, you should be able to freely embed card readers, bar code scanners, receipt printers, cash drawers, etc. Equipping your bar service and table service programs with these handheld devices will allow your staff to provide guests with the best possible service. Copper is a point of sale (POS) computer software which provides a business with a cash register system. Especially desirable are fast, thermal printers to reduce wait time for customers.</p>

<p>Heartland POS (formerly Dinerware) is a Global Payments company that offers multiple retail and restaurant POS systems for small and midsize businesses. Through the tablet's interface, customers can pay bills, sign receipts, and even offer tips for convenient cashless and paperless transactions. The most important use of this system to a business owner is its ability to allow your business to process credit card payments.</p>
<p>And many POS systems are capable of accepting almost any type of payment, including contactless payments like Apple Pay and Google Pay. That kind of (costly) frustration can't occur in retail stores. Ultimately, inventory is synchronized with less human error that is simply getting you real-time data and result for your business. Without a POS System, your customers will have to stand in a long line to wait for their checkout turn.</p>

More sophisticated POS software will actually compile data on purchases, customer history (so that big spenders can get premiere treatment), what items are moving well and what items stay stagnant. When staff members spend more time with your guests, your bar or nightclub's efficiency and reputation drastically improve.</p>
<p>Beyond processing transactions, it has reporting and inventory management features and provides access to a variety of integrations that can help you run your business, save time and boost sales. Unlike the manual inventory system, a POS system can help you analyze your previous sales data and allow you to make better decisions about product reordering.

<p>Working together with software designer and daughter Amanda their dream was to create a ground-breaking new hospitality POS system, encompassing wireless mobile ordering - not available at the time. With the cloud-based POS, the business owner can check sales from home in the POS back office account and send a daily Excel report to the accountant. For example, many retailers use POS systems to manage membership programs that award points to frequent buyers and issue discounts on future purchases.</p>
