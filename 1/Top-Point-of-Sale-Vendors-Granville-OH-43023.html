<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>POS systems let retailers track their inventory across multiple stores in different locations. These options may also encourage your customers to spend more money at your business. You can connect the POS system with most-used business applications and payment systems, like Paypal, Xero, and Quickbooks. In addition to helping owners and operators detect theft through detailed sales and inventory reporting, some bar and nightclub POS systems also offer cash drawer management to further protect against employee theft.</p>
<h2>Best Point Of Sale (POS) Software Granville</h2>
<p>Industry-specific POS packages are available-for auto repair shops, beauty and nail salons, video rental stores, dry cleaners and more. Vend's free POS software is good for small business owners who may only sell on occasion, such as a weekly farmer's market. VP of Oakley Retail, Erik Searles, shared with Chain Store Age how Oakley is using technology to draw customers into the brand's innovation. There's a reason the TouchBistro app is one of the most well-used and well-loved restaurant iPad POS systems for service workers: Its support team, cost-efficiency, and raft of features are among the best around.</p>
<p>A well-designed dashboard gives managers an overall view of their business with sales, promotions, inventory, and transaction reports. Have confidence that you can make commitments to your customers that your business can fulfill. They will also track your employees, inventory, and customers.

One popular system, the Square Point of Sale, is known for offering tiny dongles that will connect to a tablet and allow you to swipe credit cards while you're on the go. It's always good to know that this kind of mobility is available even if you might not need it right away.</p>
<p>And many POS systems are capable of accepting almost any type of payment, including contactless payments like Apple Pay and Google Pay. That kind of (costly) frustration can't occur in retail stores. Ultimately, inventory is synchronized with less human error that is simply getting you real-time data and result for your business. Without a POS System, your customers will have to stand in a long line to wait for their checkout turn.</p>
