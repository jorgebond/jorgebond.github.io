<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>We only sell ruggedized POS hardware designed to meet the strenuous demands of busy restaurants. It is a comprehensive tool equipped with features ranging from order management and payment processing to CRM and loyalty program management. Point-of-sale(POS) systems are vital to running a successful business today. Small bars typically benefit from cloud-based POS software offered on a month-to-month basis. The Epos Now system-hardware bundle includes a touch screen terminal, cash drawer, receipt printer, and EMV card reader.</p>
<h2>Types Of POS Software Systems Congers</h2>
<p>As your business grows ShopKeep's retail store software is designed to help you pivot with advanced features. But I had breakfast with a group of retailers and I asked them what kind of retail software point of sale (POS) systems they were using. Apart from order management, restaurant table management, payment handling, inventory management, employee management, and menu management, it comes with CRM capabilities- all of which we've repeatedly tried, tested and confirmed that they indeed perform well.</p>
<p>POS software is what brick and mortar retailers use to conduct sales. Accept cash, checks, credit cards or even multiple payment types on any transaction. Hence, if you get installed right or needed hardware at your business place, you will get maximum flexibility and speediness in providing services to the potential customers. A proper compliance POS system allows retailers to protect customers' privileges and gain their trust and loyalty.</p>
<p>Thus should the remote server fail, the cashier can switch over to the local sale window without disrupting sales. Many systems will integrate with accounting software like QuickBooks ( read our review ) or Xero ( read our review ), or marketing software like MailChimp ( read our review ) and some go much deeper, giving you the ability to set up eCommerce for your business or online ordering. 2. This time efficient software helps in reducing the time spent on back office and inventory management.</p>

<p>Working with leading merchant providers from around the world, Vend allows businesses to choose the best way to accept payments, including debit, credit and gift cards.

TouchBistro is one of the few restaurant POS systems that have not only perfected the basic POS functionalities, but also gone beyond them to offer exclusive, out-of-the-box extras.</p>
<p>The reporting functionality allows managers to see their sales broken down by item sales, discounts and comps, refunds, net sales, and taxes in a searchable interface that can display revenue from the past week, past 30 days, or other set timeframe. Continue selling even when the internet goes down, Your Restaurant Software will automatically re-sync sales when online. Receipt printer: Used to print receipts for customers or end-of-day reports for cashing up.</p>
<p>It differs from a cash register in that it has advanced features that make it easier for you to manage sales data, inventory, customers and employees. The cost of POS systems varies greatly depending on the business type and how many terminals are needed. Once these computers were in place, the rapid evolution of today's sophisticated retail management systems began.
