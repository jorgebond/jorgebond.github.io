<p>Point of Sale (POS) Systems have now become the business management choice for most retailers when managing their day-to-day business activities. For a store that generates annual sales, the savings can be significant by utilising a POS system. Plus, with constant staff turnaround in restaurants, an easy-to-use POS minimizes training time for getting new employees on the floor. Omnichannel by design: Manhattan POS is equipped with all of the capabilities needed to turn stores into the center of your omnichannel experience: omni cart, omni fulfillment, returns, exchanges, cross-channel promotions, complete customer transaction and interaction history across channels, and more.</p>
<p>Retailers and restaurants can benefit from comprehensive data analytics and sales processing.
