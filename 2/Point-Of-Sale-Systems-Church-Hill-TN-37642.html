<p>Choosing a Point of Sale System is not a simple task. As a result, POS systems can now be summed up as "cash registers on steroids." Even before the rise of mobile and cloud tech, POS systems took the basics of the cash register and expanded them to task directly to back-end accounting systems and credit card payment processors The cloud has become a hot trend in this space because it has let many small to midsize businesses (SMBs) make use of advanced POS systems because they can avoid the ongoing expense of deploying and maintaining a back-end server at every location.</p>
<p>When you're shopping around for a POS system, keep in mind the different types of restaurant technology and bar management software out there. Manage multiple warehouses- move stock between different businesses with the stock management system. Effectively communicate with customers and increase your sales with strategically targeted promotional emails.

Times have changed, and now the technology to record transactions and make sales may be small enough to fit into the palm of your hand. Scanning the bar code at the Point of Sale rather than typing an SKU virtually eliminates errors in pricing and inventory.</p>
<p>Point of sales systems of today function analogously to the commonplace personal computer and can run other software other than the standard POS software that is provided as standard with the purchase of the system.

<p>Labor Management and Payroll : A restaurant POS system can act as an employee time clock, with servers and staff signing in and out according to their schedules. In comparison, a customized restaurant POS system bundled with a restaurant POS PC and restaurant POS Software will allow your business do so much more. But when you are dealing with back-office functions like personnel management or inventory, things can sometimes go wrong.</p>
