<p>Choosing the right retail point of sale system and software is not a decision to take lightly. This means that, in order to access the capabilities that point of sale systems boast, you'll have to pay a fee to access the software that provides them. Cloud POS from an organization like Oracle gives you the benefit of millions of dollars of investment in data security hardware and software, which helps protect your guests and your business from hackers. This helps retailers keep track of their customers' purchases and allow them to serve them better.</p>
<p>We created Point of Success Special Edition for independent restaurants, coffee shops, cafes, bars, and quick service concepts like yours. The one thing that can take a long time when hiring a bartender for the first time is training them to learn your POS system. It comes with modules for material management, inventory, billing and kitchen management. Cost-effective - Cloud POS systems generally cost a monthly subscription fee without any contractual obligations - this can remove the entry point for a quality system without spending thousands of dollars upfront for software licensing.</p>
