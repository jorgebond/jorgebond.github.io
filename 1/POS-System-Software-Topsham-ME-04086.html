<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. A good place to start is with your inventory management system provider. Take deposits and partial payments on layaway sales, or let your customers pay on account. This POS software is acclaimed as an easy to use, powerful, and intuitive platform that enables small and midsized businesses to manage single or multi-location stores with total ease. You can follow the spending patterns from room service to reception to activities and in the restaurants or bars at the hotel.</p>

Along with an easy-to-use tablet point of sale, NCR Silver Pro Restaurant is a cloud-based POS software that delivers added benefits such as happy hour pricing, customized floor plans and house accounts valued by full service restaurants and pubs. If you plan to integrate your POS system with other software and services - such as accounting software, CMS platforms, customer loyalty programs and appointment management apps - you'll want to find out ahead of time if the integration costs extra, and whether it's a one-time or recurring fee.</p>
