<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well.

Once again, here's our quick look at the three POS services that rise above the rest when it comes to features, support, and pricing. HDRestaurant will come in handy in those situations, from billing to storing the addresses of the customer; the restaurant software takes care of everything easily.</p>

<p>In addition, the POS system may speed up transactions - which is critical in a restaurant or coffee shop, for example, where a long line at the counter leads to grumbling customers.

When choosing the best POS system for your bar, it is important to factor in the features you need and your available budget.
