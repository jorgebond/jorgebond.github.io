Point of sale (POS) system is the spot where your customer makes the payment for goods or services that are offered by your company.

The bottom line: A good restaurant POS centralizes all the processes of a restaurant, bar or cafe, allowing the manager to improve on what's working and fix what's not.

<h2>Point Of Sale Process Edgewater NJ</h2>
<p>You can use an array of tools to manage cash, inventory, orders, central product catalog, pricing and promotions, reports and dashboards, and customer information. Amazon's concept convenience store, Amazon Go, which deploys technologies that let shoppers come in, grab items, and walk out without going through a register, could revolutionize POS systems. A bar and grill, particularly a franchise where overhead is higher, properly tracking product popularity, sales and waste ultimately improves the overall bottom line of the restaurant.</p>

I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc.</p>
