<p>If you are planning on starting a new retail business, or run a retail business and wish to streamline your operation, a crucial component that should be factored into your business plans is a modern day point of sale system and more precisely the benefits a good POS system can offer to the running of your business. Acquire, retain and engage your customers, increase their average spend, manage inventory and visualize sales analytics.
