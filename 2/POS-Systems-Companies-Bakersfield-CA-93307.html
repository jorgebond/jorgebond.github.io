<p>The newest revelations to take the restaurant and hospitality industries by force - quickly etching its way into "trendsetter" capacity - are point-of-sale systems that are powered by feature-rich and slim iPad tablets. In modern terms, a POS system is typically a POS software product installed on a touchscreen hardware device. Maitre'D POS by Posera is a POS software designed for quick service and full table service restaurants, nightclubs, and bars. The Revel Bar POS system is equipped with tools to help entrepreneurs maximize their bar business. Features allow restaurants to create table maps, easily update menu items and monitor sales in real time through the Upserve mobile app.</p>
<p>While considered a Point of Sale system, Lightspeed Restaurant POS is much more. It is interesting because you get a feel of sitting in a store and executing your test cases since POS requires setup as you would see in any stores. This all-inclusive system is a platform for staff management, inventory control, back office management, reporting, and marketing. Now how the software works is that every time an item is scanned it will be deducted from the inventory database.</p>
<h2>Hospitality Pos Systems Bakersfield</h2>
<p>POS systems like Lightspeed can integrate with payment processors to automatically transit information between your inventory system and card reader. You don't need a valid internet connection to run this restaurant POS software. Payments can be by cash or credit and debit cards, or via convenient payment gateways. For example, allowing your vendors to monitor your inventory levels in real time through a POS system reduces - even eliminates - product shortages.</p>
<p>But other retail locations may prefer a mobile POS for staff to use out on the floor. In today's market, investing in an mPOS is much cheaper than investing in a POS software Thus instead of spending an extra amount of money over a regular POS software, you could actually invest in our contemporary mPOS software system that will not only help you to save an extra penny but will also provide you with added features.</p>
<p>Thus should the remote server fail, the cashier can switch over to the local sale window without disrupting sales. Many systems will integrate with accounting software like QuickBooks ( read our review ) or Xero ( read our review ), or marketing software like MailChimp ( read our review ) and some go much deeper, giving you the ability to set up eCommerce for your business or online ordering. 2. This time efficient software helps in reducing the time spent on back office and inventory management.</p>
<h2>Compare POS Systems Bakersfield CA</h2>
<p>Free POS Software can be used as a replacement to similar third-party versions employed in common retail establishments. Credit card processing rates through Lightspeed Payments are set at a predictable fee for all card types, including American Express: 2.6% + $0.10 per transaction (2.6% + $0.30 card not present). When your sales staff enter the customers' name, they can quickly call up their entire purchase history and their email address.</p>
<p>This allows the owner to keep a close tab on his staff as well as customers. We are the largest resource out there for what we do; reviewing restaurant POS systems. These are the POS systems that are most recommended by fellow business owners for their usability. But even if you trust your bartenders implicitly, you can still benefit from employee management software. Day-to-day operations are complicated and can involve everything from inventory management and purchasing, to scheduling both employees and reservations for guests.</p>
<p>A big portion of these business owners are afraid of investing the time and money in a POS system to only end up regretting it because it just didn't work as they had hoped for. It used to be that smaller businesses could not easily process credit card and check payments. ShopKeep's tablet POS system empowers you to strategically place staff throughout the store, minimizing long wait times during peak business hours.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that if you will be accepting debit and credit cards (which are required by most businesses), you need a service that will process all of your payments. A specialized system with bar-specific features will do so much more for your business than a general POS. Features include appointment scheduling, employee management, inventory tracking, integrated payment processing, and gift card and loyalty programs.</p>
