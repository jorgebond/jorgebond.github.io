Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
<p>Gone are those days when retailers used a cash register to process sales after which the data was transferred to accounts and stock list. It's a proven fact that when customers open bar tabs, they spend more. Whether you have single or multiple stores, our tools help run your business. A decent POS computer system provides features to manage a large company database, that can be conceivably shared amongst multiple store locations.</p>
