<p>POS is a short form for point of sale. Users can utilize numerous features for managing customer information, dashboards and reports, promotions and pricing, main product catalog, orders, inventory, and cash. However, a POS terminal is the electronic equipment performing the sales transaction and processing the credit card payments. Lightspeed users can also consult the Lightspeed Community to discuss their POS system with other retailers, restaurateurs and Lightspeed experts.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can monitor the sales made by your servers and manage security permissions on the POS. With POS Software you will be able to capture complete transaction details at the point of sale, and transaction history and real-time database records are stored indefinitely so your data is always available for reporting and analysis.
