<p>Trying to manage and grow a restaurant using old, antiquated processes like hand written order slips is a huge waste of time and energy. A credit card swipe is integrated with the POS system to quickly and accurately approve the customer's credit card and to input the transaction into the system. IVend POS is Windows OS based software that allows for a variety of peripherals and device configurations, including scanners, cash drawers, displays and EMV-compliant card readers. That's because it's the software that lets you track sales, issue receipts, and perform back-office functions.</p>
<p>Here we have listed some of the top features of Point of Sale Software. The POS features include cash management, table management, and delivery management. There are multiple factors in achieving PCI compliance, including the POS system and credit card processing service you use, whether your business stores cardholder data, and whether your network and internet connection are secure. Saves time - The POS system speeds up the checkout process and inventory management.</p>
<h2>Benefits A Business Gets By Using POS Software And Inventory Management Durham</h2>
<p>Square's simple and affordable POS hardware and software let you take payments anywhere your customers can meet you. Very few people (only 5.2%) pay with either checks or RFID mobile payments (sometimes called contactless payments). It is used to store Money, credit card receipts and other paperwork. UniCenta also provides customized interfaces for restaurants and retailers and the ability to operate in multiple languages and accept different currencies.</p>
<p>Built specifically for restaurants, Toast brings together many solutions from integrated online ordering and loyalty programs to payroll and labor and sales reporting, all on a mobile, cloud-based POS system. Getting a single, 360° view of your customers and stock performance from your retail POS is crucial and retailors are thinking through integration of mPOS with ePOS for greater flexibility and data unity.</p>
<p>Start seeing sales, products, customers. For instance, the point of sale system can make more detailed reports, it improves the business' accuracy, and it can help the business keep track of its inventory. But with Shopify POS, you also get staff management functions, syncing between online and face-to-face sales and hardware integration with, for example, receipt printers and cash drawers. Building loyal customers is a sure-fire way to make sure your business is sustainable for years to come.</p>
<h2>Retail EPOS Systems Durham NC</h2>
<p>Lightspeed is a powerful business management system making restaurant management easier for you and your restaurant staff. Ecommerce Platforms is a review site that shows the good, great, bad, and ugly of online store building software. When choosing the best POS solution for your retail business, there are several factors to consider. It uses an app on customers' phones plus in-store cameras, sensors, RFID, and AI to detect what customers carry out of the store and then automatically charges their credit cards.</p>
<p>When customers come back to try and reach your loyalty program's bonuses, they'll slowly start to feel that sense of belonging and being-at-home in your bar, which is the foundation for creating a regular bar customer. With the ability to track reservations and know which tables are reserved at the beginning of service, it becomes much easier to seat walk-in customers. Hence, we've declared it the best budget POS system for restaurants.</p>
<p>You avoid entering the same data twice as all sales are automatically registered in the accounts. The price, lower than most POS software services in the restaurant business, is also a big selling point. We customized the user interface to include fields for the exact data we need to sell online - things like name, subname, item, weight, dimensions, UPC, and at least three photos which we get from our wholesalers.</p>

<p>More than simply a way to take orders and ring up sales, a POS system gives you total control over every important operational aspect of your restaurant. Lightspeed has month-to-month and annual service contracts available, gives you a choice of credit card processors, and works with third-party POS equipment. The other feature they'll look for in a POS system is the ability to offer customers the convenience of unattended ordering and checkout options.</p>
