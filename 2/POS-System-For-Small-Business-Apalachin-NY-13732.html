<p>POS software offer's your business many conveniences that you simply can't afford to be without. The retail boom has been fuelled by new business model of franchising where multiple entrepreneurs take up part of the risk of inventory.

With Poster, you can reduce your startup costs and switch between payment plans anytime to catch up with your business growth.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well. Retail merchants, for example, can operate with an internet-enabled device, terminal stand, credit card reader, receipt printer, and cash drawer. Once again, here's our quick look at the three POS services that rise above the rest when it comes to features, support, and pricing.
