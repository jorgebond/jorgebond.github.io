<p>Easy Retail for You (er4u) Small Business POS Software can be used on a number of devices or hardwares. Cloud-based and on-premise solution that allows restaurants to streamline point-of-sale operations with scheduling, reporting and more. You can analyze sales data, figure out how well all the items on your shelves sell, and adjust purchasing levels accordingly. Beyond ringing up sales and accepting payments, you want a system that streamlines related processes such as inventory and customer management. A retail POS system may also include a barcode scanner and customer-facing screen.</p>
<p>With the bar tab feature, pre-authorize credit cards so collecting payment is a breeze, and feel at ease because you won't be responsible for a stack of credit cards sitting behind the bar any longer. Likewise, gift and loyalty programs—whether for retail or hospitality customers —can turn payment into a personalized guest experience in which you reward customers, run targeted promotions, and gather key data on preferences and behaviors.</p>
