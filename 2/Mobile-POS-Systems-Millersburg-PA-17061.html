<p>There are a lot of products which can be used in the restaurant or food franchising industry and one of them is through the use of the POS systems or Point of Sale systems. Operating a retail store calls for a range of administrative, management and marketing skills. Opting for a POS software provider that offers both proprietary and open source hardware, provides you with the most freedom and flexibility which ultimately results in the most bang for your buck. The cash drawer should be compatible with the rest of the system if purchasing the POS hardware separately. A mobile web study found out that smartphones were used in over a third of total US retail sales in 2018 or equivalent to more than $1 trillion in purchases.</p>
<p>When you're shopping around for a POS system, keep in mind the different types of restaurant technology and bar management software out there.

Scheduling employees and staying on top of their hours is possible from the POS too, and our POS can be integrated with your payroll management software.</p>
