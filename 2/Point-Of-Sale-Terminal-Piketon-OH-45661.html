<p>There are EPoS systems which have been developed with the hospitality industry in mind. In this day and age, a POS system is a requirement for any business, not just restaurants. Even though different types of restaurants have different needs for POS functionality, they all need reliable support and service to keep operations running. The smart restaurant POS software also allows you to split guest bills by food type and quantity. Mobile payments - In business, mobile payment options have made the transactions more accessible and safer and can even improve customer service.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>

From desktop to mobile POS to self-service, Intel® processors and technologies power the point of sale and deliver hardware-enhanced security to help encrypt and protect data.</p>

There are a lot of specialized systems out there for the restaurant or hospitality business, so if you're selling flowers or handmade bags, make sure you find a POS tool with all of the bells and whistles to make your products sing and your customers stick around.</p>

While there are several kinds of payment processing solutions available, including credit card readers and various new mobile payment methods, the POS systems we reviewed are full-on cash registers.</p>

Understanding what a POS system is—its software and hardware components, as well as capabilities—will enable you to make an educated buying decision. Hospitality point of sale systems are computerized systems incorporating registers, computers and peripheral equipment, usually on a computer network to be used in restaurants, hair salons or hotels.</p>
<p>The user purchases the POS system with hardware and accessories such as to monitor screen, cash register, barcode scanner, receipt printer, and card readers. Many restaurant owners are familiar with POS systems because basic versions are usually included in retail or restaurant packages Restaurant systems are normally equipped with a terminal, a touch-screen monitor, and a cash drawer.

It provides flexible reporting and cost & labor saving inventory management tools that help identify vulnerable areas of the business.
