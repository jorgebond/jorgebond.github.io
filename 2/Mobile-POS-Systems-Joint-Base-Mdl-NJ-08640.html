<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
<p>POS systems let retailers track their inventory across multiple stores in different locations. These options may also encourage your customers to spend more money at your business. You can connect the POS system with most-used business applications and payment systems, like Paypal, Xero, and Quickbooks. In addition to helping owners and operators detect theft through detailed sales and inventory reporting, some bar and nightclub POS systems also offer cash drawer management to further protect against employee theft.</p>
<h2>Point Of Sale (POS) Software Joint Base Mdl</h2>
<p>With powerful features for single or multi-store locations, our solutions will help you seamlessly manage your sales, inventory and accounting so you can spend more time running your business, less time on your tools.

The tableside POS enables staff to serve customers efficiently from showcasing the menu to order taking, to checkout and payment.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that not all restaurant POS systems are one-size-fits-all solutions. Eliminating a fixed bar POS system can raise a bar's customer experience to new heights by creating a modern sales experience that is rife with today's latest technology. If you need internal security, manage data access with employee passcodes for checking individual sales and refunds. It also offers software for business intelligence, analytics and customer engagement.</p>

Retailers need to consider the negative consequences of failing to have a POS in place. Successful retail stores rely heavily on their software from online fulfillment systems to buy online pick-up in store (BOPIS), from tracking loyalty and employee hours to marketing via text and email messaging.</p>

Instead of using traditional punch cards, you can now track your customer loyalty incentives using the POS system. Our retail POS solution is a very robust and includes a feature-rich touchscreen terminal and software created with automated programming in place to help make your day-to-day business operations much more manageable and to make your business more profitable.</p>
