<p>Whether you're selling gardening supplies, trendy clothes, or high-end electronics, your retail store's success is largely connected to your cash management procedures. And an open API makes adding third-party applications far easier than with the majority of restaurant POS systems. Customers appreciate when their food is delivered on time, and when their orders are not mixed up. For a restaurant this could mean greater customer retention, and more satisfied clients. By empowering in-store associates with a customer's purchase history, online browsing, and cart abandons, POS can increase basket size and same-store sales, even as you drive loyalty by exceeding customer expectations.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>

<p>But when it comes to providing detailed sales reports, some systems blow others out of the water. Linga POS is an iPad POS system for restaurants from Benseron Hospitality. If the restaurant has primarily chosen a cloud-based POS system but their internet is not 100% reliable, they can connect an on-site server enabling the software to function when the internet is down and sync the data in the cloud when the internet is back up and running.</p>
<p>Still, for retail businesses that want a straightforward POS system for online and in-person sales, Shopify packs a potent punch. There are two main components in restaurant pos hardware and system, the front desk and the back kitchen. Management features include Payroll, EMV Chip Tabs, Employee activity tracking, Real time training, Extensive reporting, Automated discounting, Trade accounts, Gift cards, Tickets splinting, Customer head counts, Table management, Customer records, Void Comp Discount Waste Override and Theft tracking system.</p>
<p>That said, Square for Restaurants is recognized as the best POS system for restaurants primarily because of its remarkable balance between simplicity and management functionalities.
