<p>All the Point of Sale systems serves the purpose of keeping a close track of daily sales. Shopify POS is an iPad and iPhone-based point of sale application that allows you to manage your entire online and physical store business using a unified platform. Having these options is mostly a no-brainer these days because you have access to all your sales and programming data online remotely or through an App. POS software records each sale when it happens, so your inventory records are always up-to-date.</p>
<p>On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed. While its Square Point of Sale App is an all-in-one software for pretty much any business, Square for Restaurants is rather an optimized version with the specific features that restaurant business owners need. POS functions include employee scheduling and management, sales reporting, inventory management and more.</p>

When deciding on a bar POS system, it's important to talk to a representative to find out if they have all the features you need, and what they will cost—often, the starter” or core” package does not include more sophisticated features like advanced reporting, the loyalty program, or granular inventory controls.</p>
