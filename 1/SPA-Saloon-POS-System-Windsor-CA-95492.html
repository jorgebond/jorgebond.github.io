<p>Small and mid-size business owners need a Retail POS platform that is capable of managing payment transactions, inventory and purchasing management, pricing, sales and product promotions for single and multi-store locations. Indeed, these systems are often well suited for small businesses because they are the least expensive of the POS system options, they nonetheless provide many helpful features, including automatic sales and tax calculation ability; calculation of change owed to the customer; sales report generation capability; capacity to sort food stamps and trading stamps (through programming of function keys); and scanning.</p>
<p>Lightspeed is an iPad POS system that has solutions for retail stores, restaurants and online businesses. The traditional restaurant Point Of Sale brought with itself the miracle of customer data. Upserve POS focuses on small restaurants but can also accommodate large, multilocation bars. For delivery restaurants, Revel lets employees quickly store customer information with an address field. Despite Cybersys POS's low pricing, it comes with all the features of your standard POS systems like ecommerce integration, reporting, inventory management, and employee access management.</p>

There are hundreds of point of sale (POS) systems available to small businesses, and several are geared toward retail businesses specifically. It is important to anticipate your business growth and choose a bar POS system that will allow you to expand as you see fit.

<p>As you may be aware, bar menus tend to change from time to time. POS is not a standalone machine or process - it's a constellation of things that together enable you to process customer-facing transactions efficiently and streamline business processes connected with your sales.
