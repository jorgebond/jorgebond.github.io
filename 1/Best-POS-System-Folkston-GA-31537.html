<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>
<p>Features include order management, a delivery app for drivers, employee scheduling and a timeclock, ingredient-based inventory tracking, and reporting tools. The software is essentially an online ordering platform for restaurants, convenience stores, takeaways, multi-store chains, cafes, delis, and franchises. ShopKeep doesn't allow for multiple sales tax rates, doesn't integrate with any online stores, and can't handle payment with gift cards.</p>
