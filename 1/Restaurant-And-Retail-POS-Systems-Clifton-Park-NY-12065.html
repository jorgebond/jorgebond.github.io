One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>

<h2>Hospitality POS Clifton Park NY</h2>
<p>Adjustable floor planner is highly customizable and easy to use for bar-restaurant setups or nightclubs offering table service. Most good Point of Sale systems have common functionality in the traditional areas of selling, printing receipts, handling customer accounts, managing discounting and reporting on sales.

<h3>Retail Systems Inc. Point Of Sale Systems Clifton Park New York</h3>
<p>Modern POS systems provide an easy way to keep your inventory tracking under control. Waiterio was crafted with the sole aim of making restaurant management an economically viable and quick task for budding restaurateurs and other food business owners. Inventory management is a requirement for most operations. Easy to use, TouchBistro can help increase the efficiency of your employees and lets them focus on providing great customer service instead of running back and forth between front and back of house.</p>
<p>We believe that restaurant point of sale and inventory management software should be mobile and affordable. Customers rate their experience alerting managers when a patron isn't satisfied with the service. Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle. Bottom Line: Paying with your iPhone via the Apple Pay mobile-payment system is a convenient and secure experience, but for now it's not possible all that often.</p>

<p>This system will let you look at and manage business data in real time from any place you may be with the aid of an Internet-enabled device. Businesses are increasingly adopting POS systems, and one of the most obvious and compelling reasons is that a POS system does away with the need for price tags Selling prices are linked to the product code of an item when adding stock, so the cashier merely needs to scan this code to process a sale.</p>
