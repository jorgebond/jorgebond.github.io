Other features include a 360-degree Point-of-Sale Software with Recurring Billing, Sales & Order Reporting, and Electronic Invoicing. KORONA's retail POS systems store your data using cloud POS technology. I'm talking about typical restaurants, cafes, coffee shops, bars, etc.</p>
<p>Manage Specials - POS systems automate the process of tracking current and marked down pricing. Bar menus change all the time, and your point of sale system should adapt to it. Whether you offer happy hour specials or a new food item on your menu, you want a system that can sync all the information. Improves inventory management, a crucial component of a busy deli.

Vend comes with the following features (and more): eCommerce, a loyalty program, customer management, inventory management, barcode creation, and price books that can be used to store different prices for sales.</p>
<p>With iVend POS, you only pay for the software per device, regardless of the number of cashiers and employees. Free to start and full of powerful and well-designed features, Square is the best POS solution for most small businesses.

For the business looking to integrate third-party hardware and software, eZee makes it easy to incorporate a variety of additional programs. You want to look at both the front end of the software, which you use to place orders and accept payments, and the back-office features that you use to manage the system.</p>
<p>With Harbortouch's free POS program, we'd be remiss by not adding a retail point of sale system to our product line of software and hardware products. The user can use cash, debit cards, mobile payments, or credit cards for the payment. It can be all too easy to lose track of someone's drink order or miss a customer waiting to place a drink order at the bar. Here is an ugly truth: No matter how credit card improves, cash still holds its position on consumers' behavior.</p>
