<p>Choosing the right retail point of sale system and software is not a decision to take lightly. This means that, in order to access the capabilities that point of sale systems boast, you'll have to pay a fee to access the software that provides them. Cloud POS from an organization like Oracle gives you the benefit of millions of dollars of investment in data security hardware and software, which helps protect your guests and your business from hackers. This helps retailers keep track of their customers' purchases and allow them to serve them better.</p>

Modern POS systems can double as employee management tools, letting you do things like set individual user permissions and generate reports to see who is making the most sales, who is bringing in the most tips, who is comping the most drinks, etc. Setting up Cybersys POS is a straightforward process, with your list of customers, suppliers, or gift cards easily transferred from one store to the next.</p>
<p>Then this information is sent to the software in the main system, which matches information from the bar code with information in the database listing the inventory. Thousands of restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and food service establishments have chosen SoftTouch POS.
