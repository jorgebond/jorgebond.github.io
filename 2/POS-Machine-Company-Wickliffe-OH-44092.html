<p>Toast's integrated CRM software can help you build an inventory of loyal customers and craft messages and promotions to keep your guests happy and your business profitable. The bottom line: A good restaurant POS centralizes all the processes of a restaurant, bar or cafe, allowing the manager to improve on what's working and fix what's not. Besides increasing convenience, this could enable POSs, loyalty, and payments to be rolled into a single customer-centric experience.</p>

Payments can also take place directly in the Restaurant POS. NorthStar from Custom Business Solutions is an iPad POS system for quick- and full-service restaurants, cafes, bars, amusement parks, and cruise lines.</p>
