<p>Purchasing a restaurant POS system on the internet can be a complex process due to the number of systems and options. After the pen and paper way of taking orders, the next thing to enter the restaurant industry was the first POS system It was a basic cash register, a computer-based system introduced by IBM. 5. Point of sale systems allow you to track what customers purchase so that you can learn more about your customers, their buying habits, and personal preferences. Clover also features advanced loyalty tools to help you attract repeat customers.</p>
<p>Infinity POS is always on and offers near real-time customer and offer information that staff can use to encourage purchase and upsell.
