<p>The early days of using a cash register and pen and notebook for accounting and processing transactions are no longer an effective means of keeping up with today's advancements in business technology. POS vendors and retailers are working hard to standardise the technology behind POS systems, to drive down manufacturing and product costs. With open API's, these POS systems can allow integration platforms like DBSync to share the data with various other apps securely, thus avoiding double data entry. From taking orders in a coffee shop, booking hotel rooms, selling event tickets, retail stores, or restaurants.</p>
<p>The POS system is widely deployed by ecommerce stores and many brick-and-mortar stores.

Data collection and analytics - The POS system collects customer details along with data and tax information. Its mobile implementation is equally capable with a one-touch payment feature to support a responsive build and superior micro-moments technology to drive your brand and actual growth of sales.</p>

<p>Some POS software has built-in payment processing while others work with third-party integration. With some retail systems, you can buy your own computers and then buy the POS software for your business separately. DBSync , a pioneer in the field, allows for seamless integration, providing complete control over the business and optimizing sales. This feature helps protect a bar business from running out of product, which can be one of the most damaging forces to an exceptional customer experience.</p>

Also available are additional hardware, including bar-code scanners and receipt printers, to use with the POS software. Our projects range from single-purpose tasks for small businesses to highly complex, multi-platform systems for large corporate clients.</p>

The $29 Basic Shopify plan is an affordable option for smaller retail businesses, but only if you're selling products exclusively online. Disregarding that fact for the time being, compare a retail store with a POS System to an almost identical store with a standard electronic cash register - there are much differences than first meets the eye.</p>
