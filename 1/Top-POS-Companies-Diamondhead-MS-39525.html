For a while, on-site POS software has been the norm for computerised POS systems , but it is now more common to use cloud-based or hybrid systems relying on both the internet and local hosting. We've been assisting and simplifying the daily routine of retail businesses since 2001.</p>

The cash only retail business is quickly fading into obscurity.</p>
