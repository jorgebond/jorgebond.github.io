<p>Reward vouchers printed at point of sale can help keep diners and drinkers loyal. Manage your restaurant with inventory management, employee management, and live sales figures. Your POS equipment can provide your customers with more information on the product, and can even suggest additional products that match the original sale to make the upsale easier. Good point-of-sales software should let you receive payment for services and products. The software integrates well with other systems from Sysco like Cake OrderPad, Cake Guest Manager, and Cake Online Ordering.</p>

Not all Point of Sale (POS) solutions are the same, and each business needs slightly different features when choosing a POS machine. At the end of the first night of business with the new point of sale system we looked at the sales totals and found that they had done $300 more than identical nights in the recent past.</p>
<p>Programming - Your point of sale software has to be programmed to accept your menu, products, and inventory that you'll be selling.

<p>It's the tool you use to analyze and order your inventory, employees, customers, and sales. We have been providing a bar & restaurant point of sale (POS) system for years. Mobile point of sale devices allow bartenders and servers to take and transmit drink orders electronically, and transfer tabs electronically (so customers won't have to close out at the bar before moving to restaurant seating, for example).</p>
<p>Manage your business with a robust iPad POS system. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city. There is only 1 thing we can think of that will drive customers away faster than bad food and that is slow service.</p>
