<p>Bar staff often work without direct supervision and liquor waste and theft is hard to detect or prevent. Many systems also feature add-on modules such as payroll time clocks and customer preference databases. Technological advances such as point of sale systems, email ordering and computerized kitchens have taken fast service to a new level. Flexibility - At this point, many POS transactions are card-based, not cash-based. ShopKeep can be used for payment processing, inventory management, transactions, customer marketing, staff management, reporting and analytics, and more.</p>

<h3>Using Technology To Improve The Bar And Grill Business North Platte Nebraska</h3>
<p>PointOS was founded by bar and restaurant professionals to provide a cost effective, full-featured and user-friendly restaurant management platform that helps restaurants and bars operate more efficiently and profitably. This free POS software can perform all of the common register functions, track up to 13,000 SKU's, monitor sales of up to 56 employees, and handle daily sales reporting. When we started, we used to write all of our sales on a piece of paper, but soon we realised that we needed an efficient POS to automate our work.</p>
<p>Choosing the right point of sale (POS) system is vital for small businesses. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is leading the IoT revolution in retail systems, allowing for end-to-end inventory control, smooth tracking of goods through purchase, and eliminating the need for barcode scanners at the register. For example, if you're opening up a salon, you may want to look for a POS system that can handle complex scheduling and one that can manage payments and tipping to multiple individual employees.</p>
