The starter plan is best suited for cafes, standard plan is good for fast casual restaurants, and pro plan is best for full-service restaurants. Synchronize your online and retail customers. While many of the functions of POS software can be done simply with pen and paper and a cash register, POS tools keep all that information easily accessible in one place.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>
