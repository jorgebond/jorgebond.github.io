Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
<p>Having an efficient Point of Sale (POS) solution can go a long way in ensuring that all your business operations are running smoothly. Simplifying transaction and record keeping, and eliminating the need for separate point of sale terminals, businesses will have more time to focus on customer service. Some of the features sets you want to look for are inventory, customer and employee management. Provides an invaluable tool that allows you to not only process purchases but integrates inventory, customer info, returns, exchanges, credit card processing, rewards programs, sales, records, etc all on one machine.</p>

<p>Toast's integrated CRM software can help you build an inventory of loyal customers and craft messages and promotions to keep your guests happy and your business profitable. The bottom line: A good restaurant POS centralizes all the processes of a restaurant, bar or cafe, allowing the manager to improve on what's working and fix what's not. Besides increasing convenience, this could enable POSs, loyalty, and payments to be rolled into a single customer-centric experience.</p>
<p>Restaurants can process payments through Upserve at a flat rate per transaction or integrate with third-party processors Heartland Payments, Chase Paymentech, First Data, TSYS or Global Payment. ShopKeep's simple, powerful, iPad POS empowers businesses to thrive, while doing what they love the most.

<h2>Hospitality Point Of Sale Systems Fulton MS</h2>
<p>In fact, an online presence has become so necessary that some systems, such as Shopify POS and Vend POS, include it as part of their package. When deciding on a bar POS system, it's important to talk to a representative to find out if they have all the features you need, and what they will cost—often, the starter” or core” package does not include more sophisticated features like advanced reporting, the loyalty program, or granular inventory controls.</p>
<p>We build custom software for small business including stock control, retail barcode systems, restaurant point of sale (pos),internet cyber cafes, internet shops, e-commerce websites, online shops , hosting etc. POS systems have changed significantly within a very short period of time. Improve your customer service with business insights either at the site or remotely. A POS transaction is the moment where a transaction is finalized or the moment where a customer tenders payment in exchange for goods and services.</p>
<p>As the store plays a larger role, it's time for point of sale (POS) to expand its role, too. Enabling associates to save the sale and inspire customers through personalized selling anywhere in the store. No matter how sophisticated your restaurant software solution might be, it's only as powerful as the people who use it. Make sure the restaurant POS software you choose is easy for employees to use, and that you have someone on staff to manage the new system and train others to use it effectively.</p>
