<p>Restaurant POS, or point of sale system, combines software and hardware for centralizing a restaurant's business operations. Instead, let us sort through the crud and recommend the right POS systems for small businesses. With this, you can also manage payments and seamlessly track sales and profits. But no matter how well prepared the menu, or how engaging and talented the staff, there needs to be a solid business infrastructure in place. To begin with, as you make sales, the system should be able to track what has been sold, how many items still remain, when you are out of that item, and notify you ahead of time so that you can restock.</p>
<p>Here we have listed some of the top features of Point of Sale Software. The POS features include cash management, table management, and delivery management. There are multiple factors in achieving PCI compliance, including the POS system and credit card processing service you use, whether your business stores cardholder data, and whether your network and internet connection are secure. Saves time - The POS system speeds up the checkout process and inventory management.</p>

Our SCM software helps you to systematically align your business functions right from procurement to inventory, manufacturing to sales estimation and invoices.</p>
<p>There is a big difference between POS systems and cash registers , but generally speaking, functionality is typically uniform across platforms in the sense that a POS machine is used to ring up sales and to accept payments. With an online POS, you can use your own hardware. Toast POS is one of the few providers of an Android POS system, which is more suitable for restaurants due to the flexibility and affordability of the Android infrastructure.</p>
<p>Point-of-sale systems, as a result, are basically cash registers on steroids.” POS software expanded the basics of the cash register directly into credit card payment processors and back-end accounting. Since the point-of-sale system was now keeping an individual record for each inventory item, retailers wanted to maintain their stocking levels in the computer. From inventory management and sales tracking, to sales reporting and customer loyalty programs, AIMsi covers it all.</p>
