<p>Point of sale (POS) is a technology for financial transactions at retail establishments, for example, at a supermarket. To evolve into a valuable component of Retail 4.0, POS systems will need IoT connectivity.

Download the app for free and there is no monthly fee and credit card sales will appear in the merchant's account overnight.
