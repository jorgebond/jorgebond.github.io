<p>The point-of-sale is where it all happens. Vape Shops: Although casual consumers tend to classify vape stores with tobacco shops, these two business types typically use different point of sale features. POS Guys systems are compatible with all credit card processors or merchant services, making payment more convenient for customers. They make it easier to run your entire business, with features that help you analyze sales data, track inventory, connect with customers and manage employees.</p>
<p>Cashier Live works for all retail stores, but it has special features for boutiques, hardware stores and pharmacies. The scheduler is an online booking tool that allows your customers to book appointments for services when they purchase their Groupon deal. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location.</p>
