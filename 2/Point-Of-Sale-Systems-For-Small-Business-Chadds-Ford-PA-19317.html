<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>We created Point of Success Special Edition for independent restaurants, coffee shops, cafes, bars, and quick service concepts like yours.

Not all Point of Sale (POS) solutions are the same, and each business needs slightly different features when choosing a POS machine. At the end of the first night of business with the new point of sale system we looked at the sales totals and found that they had done $300 more than identical nights in the recent past.</p>

<p>However, ShopKeep has a strong set of features that makes it suitable for smaller, quick-service restaurants. When choosing the best POS system for your bar, it is important to factor in the features you need and your available budget.
