<p>However, ShopKeep has a strong set of features that makes it suitable for smaller, quick-service restaurants. When choosing the best POS system for your bar, it is important to factor in the features you need and your available budget. Some sales people need to be reminded that this is your choice and that you will choose the system which is right for your business. Many small restaurants still operate on a cash-only basis.</p>
