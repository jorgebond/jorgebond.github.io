<p>A supermarket with high traffic cannot afford a systemic failure, hence each point of sale station should not only be very robust both in terms of software, database and hardware specifications but also designed in such a way as to prevent causing a systemic failure - such as may happen through the use of a single central database for operations. Let your customers shop their way with the ability to refund or exchange online purchases at any retail location.</p>
<p>Nowadays cash registers have become more sophisticated and they are used to process credit cards. Epos Now also makes it easy to manage employee timesheets and payroll as staff can clock in and out directly through the POS system.
