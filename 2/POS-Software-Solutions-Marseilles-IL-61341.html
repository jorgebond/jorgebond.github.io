<p>This multipurpose system works for nightclubs, bars, full service, fast, and casual restaurants, as well as bakeries and food trucks. This core personal computer operates the Point of Sale software which processes the data and reports on it. The monitor is a screen which visually displays the transaction. But things can always go wrong, especially when you're dealing with back-office functions such as inventory or personnel management.</p>

You can use it to take orders tableside, track inventory at the ingredient level, manage customers, offer loyalty promotions and generate reports. With POS systems that offer this feature, you'll be able to track transaction history, take notes, and potentially even contact customers, all through your point of sale.

<p>It's the tool you use to analyze and order your inventory, employees, customers, and sales. We have been providing a bar & restaurant point of sale (POS) system for years. Mobile point of sale devices allow bartenders and servers to take and transmit drink orders electronically, and transfer tabs electronically (so customers won't have to close out at the bar before moving to restaurant seating, for example).</p>
<p>POS software, in tandem with some kind of hardware, allows you to process all of these types of transactions. The orders taken from the customers are forwarded to the staff working in the kitchen. But, all in all, small retail businesses, coffee shops, and general restaurants make up the bulk of ShopKeep's user base, which stretches beyond 23,000. Whereas, department stores usually put a POS at varying locations through their shops.</p>
