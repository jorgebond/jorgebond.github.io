<p>Like their printer counterpart an all-in-one POS system combines multiple technologies and integrates them into one housing to maximize value plus convenience to the end user. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can monitor the sales made by your servers and manage security permissions on the POS. With POS Software you will be able to capture complete transaction details at the point of sale, and transaction history and real-time database records are stored indefinitely so your data is always available for reporting and analysis. Mobile point of sale systems that utilize handheld tablets eliminate the clunky technology that typically stands between staff and guests.</p>

STEM is an integrated suite of retail and hospitality management modules that enable you to manage your businesses successfully and maximize profits.

<p>You need to make sure that the POS hardware - the scanners, computers, and printers - is compatible with the software you have chosen. Because of the importance of accurate data capture in sophisticated point-of-sale systems, retailers are increasingly turning to scanning as an alternative to error-prone keypunch entry."
