<p>Like their printer counterpart an all-in-one POS system combines multiple technologies and integrates them into one housing to maximize value plus convenience to the end user. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>When you're shopping around for a POS system, keep in mind the different types of restaurant technology and bar management software out there. Manage multiple warehouses- move stock between different businesses with the stock management system. Effectively communicate with customers and increase your sales with strategically targeted promotional emails. Scheduling employees and staying on top of their hours is possible from the POS too, and our POS can be integrated with your payroll management software.</p>
