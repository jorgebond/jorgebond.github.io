<h2>Point Of Sale Software For Small Business Franklin Park NJ</h2>
<p>Lightspeed is a powerful business management system making restaurant management easier for you and your restaurant staff. Ecommerce Platforms is a review site that shows the good, great, bad, and ugly of online store building software.

I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc.</p>
