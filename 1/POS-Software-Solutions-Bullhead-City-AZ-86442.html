<p>A point of sale machine is a computerized replacement for a cash register. Even if you don't employ delivery staff, these third-party services will order, pick up, and deliver the food, generating more sales with little additional work. For an all-in-one system for taking payments wherever your customers are, pair the Square POS and mPOS systems together to give your business an extra boost. Besides accepting credit and debit cards and cash, restaurants must accept gift cards and mobile payments to stay competitive.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>
