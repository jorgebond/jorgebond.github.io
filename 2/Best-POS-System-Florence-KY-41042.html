<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>Some restaurants are adopting a customer-facing POS with tabletop devices providing upsells and remote service. Using integrated technology to track data helps retailers catch discrepancies in pricing or cash flow that could lead to profit loss or interrupt sales. While each of those establishments are classified as restaurants, they all have very different demands when it comes to choosing the right POS system for their specific needs.</p>
<h2>What Are The Advantages Of A Point Of Sale Florence</h2>
<p>POS systems like Lightspeed can integrate with payment processors to automatically transit information between your inventory system and card reader. You don't need a valid internet connection to run this restaurant POS software. Payments can be by cash or credit and debit cards, or via convenient payment gateways. For example, allowing your vendors to monitor your inventory levels in real time through a POS system reduces - even eliminates - product shortages.</p>
<p>You can accept payments directly by swiping and inserting the customer's cards, scanning checks, and accepting gift cards right on your POS system. The PointOS platform provides an all in one point of sale system with features ranging from inventory and labor forecasting, to detailed reports and analytics that help you to make the right decisions for your business. Beyond offering customers secure payment processing options, restaurants should offer tableside ordering.</p>
<p>The days of conventional cash registers are almost over, as the modern point-of-sale (POS) has grown its popularity in the last few years. Typical hardware needs for POS set-ups include: credit-card swipers, computer terminals, monitors, bar-code scanners, receipt printers, touchscreens, computer peripherals such as keyboards and mice, and cash-drawers. Lightspeed offers a complete set of functionalities, including inventory management, reporting and analytics, multi-payments, customer loyalty, and training and support.</p>
