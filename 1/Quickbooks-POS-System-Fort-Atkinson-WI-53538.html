<p>A point of sale machine is a computerized replacement for a cash register. Even if you don't employ delivery staff, these third-party services will order, pick up, and deliver the food, generating more sales with little additional work. For an all-in-one system for taking payments wherever your customers are, pair the Square POS and mPOS systems together to give your business an extra boost. Besides accepting credit and debit cards and cash, restaurants must accept gift cards and mobile payments to stay competitive.</p>

<h2>Manage Your Small Business Restaurant With A POS System Fort Atkinson</h2>

<p>ShopKeep also runs on Clover devices, such as Clover Station and Clover Mini Though it doesn't include as many industry-specific features as some other systems, ShopKeep has an affordable price point (monthly rates are customized for each business) and has a lot to offer in the areas of inventory and employee management. It allows businesses to boost service quality while offering data reporting and order tracking capabilities.</p>
<p>Unlike the traditional cash register system where you cannot tell which staff member on shift rang up the sale, if you upgrade your POS equipment, you will be able to tell which staff member does what. With this software, you can increase your sales, track inventories, manage employees, and automate restaurant operations conveniently using your tablet. We're not the best fit for everyone, and if our retail point of sale won't meet the needs of your retail business, we'll be the first to tell you.</p>
