<p>Choosing a Point of Sale System is not a simple task. As a result, POS systems can now be summed up as "cash registers on steroids." Even before the rise of mobile and cloud tech, POS systems took the basics of the cash register and expanded them to task directly to back-end accounting systems and credit card payment processors The cloud has become a hot trend in this space because it has let many small to midsize businesses (SMBs) make use of advanced POS systems because they can avoid the ongoing expense of deploying and maintaining a back-end server at every location.</p>
<p>Here we have listed some of the top features of Point of Sale Software. The POS features include cash management, table management, and delivery management. There are multiple factors in achieving PCI compliance, including the POS system and credit card processing service you use, whether your business stores cardholder data, and whether your network and internet connection are secure. Saves time - The POS system speeds up the checkout process and inventory management.</p>

The system comes with free downloadable software plus a Square magstripe reader, enabling payments via debit and credit cards.</p>
<p>Restaurants stand and fall on the quality of their food and the friendliness and dedication of their staff. Mobile features use apps or mobile-friendly websites to allow customers to place orders or make purchases remotely using their phones, tablets or computers.
