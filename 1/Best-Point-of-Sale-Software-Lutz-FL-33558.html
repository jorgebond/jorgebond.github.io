<p>In this article, you'll read about what we found to be the 20 best POS systems for restaurants in the market today based on core features, restaurant management tools, ease of use and more. A restaurant POS system with features for online ordering, live table booking, purchase ordering, stock control, and more. Not only can Free POS Software provide a basic level of functionality, but there are other features worth noting.</p>
<p>Since implementation of a POS system is requires a large investment in time and money, the selection of software and hardware requires careful research into the features available and associated costs. For keyed-in transactions, customers pay a 3.5% transaction cost plus $0.15. Customers who personally use their card to dip, tap, and swipe, they pay slightly lower transaction fees (2.75%). Many small businesses benefit from buying their POS hardware outright, since POS leases can be tied to credit card processing and have lengthy contracts.</p>
