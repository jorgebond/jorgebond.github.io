<p>Ready for commerce: Built entirely on microservices, Manhattan POS with Resilient Cloud technology delivers the always-available cloud POS that helps retailers continuously innovate to stay ahead of customer demands.

<p>This multipurpose system works for nightclubs, bars, full service, fast, and casual restaurants, as well as bakeries and food trucks. This core personal computer operates the Point of Sale software which processes the data and reports on it. The monitor is a screen which visually displays the transaction. But things can always go wrong, especially when you're dealing with back-office functions such as inventory or personnel management.</p>
<p>With the POS software, you don't need terminals, cash registers, barcode scanners, or receipt and label printers. But just because you have someone on the phone doesn't mean your system is back online; you're still losing revenue every time an impatient customer walks out of the store. For a restaurant, it's especially important to turn over tables quickly and ensure that customers receive the correct food (with any special orders accommodated) in a timely fashion.</p>

But it should be clear that the more extensive the restaurant service, the more advanced and varied the POS software must be to fully support all daily operations.</p>
