<p>Ready for commerce: Built entirely on microservices, Manhattan POS with Resilient Cloud technology delivers the always-available cloud POS that helps retailers continuously innovate to stay ahead of customer demands.

The myFocus Cloud includes mobile management and alerts, cloud-based reporting, customer loyalty, and gift card solutions.</p>
<p>But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. It takes the payment of the customers by adding up the totals along with the sales tax. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to. Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>

From POS to sales reporting and analytics, it's the best restaurant POS management system available. If you are keeping the pizza delivery part of your business while also running the pizza restaurant, these features will be in addition to the "must have" features from the previous paragraph.</p>
