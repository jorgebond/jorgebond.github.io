<p>We believe that restaurant point of sale and inventory management software should be mobile and affordable.

Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle. Bottom Line: Paying with your iPhone via the Apple Pay mobile-payment system is a convenient and secure experience, but for now it's not possible all that often.</p>

Many Nordstrom Rack stores combine static register POS terminals with mobile POS systems to allow employees to reduce lines at their traditional register stations - one or two employees can clear half a dozen shoppers from a line in relatively little time.</p>
