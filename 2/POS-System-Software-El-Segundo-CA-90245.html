<p>Point of sale (POS) can be referred to as a check-out or cash wrap and is usually the location in a store or restaurant where transactions for the exchange goods and services occur. Some retailers choose to operate an RMS by assembling the various pieces from different software vendors: a POS system from Vendor A, an inventory management system from Vendor B, purchasing management from Vendor C, a business intelligence tool from Vendor D, an ecommerce system from Vendor E and so on. The costs of implementing multiple disparate systems and getting them to work together in harmony is prohibitive for all but the largest retail businesses.</p>
<p>POSGuys offers a wide range of products for retailers, restaurants and salons. Having a specialized POS for bars makes it easy for customers to calculate a tip. From cash, credit card, check, debit, on account, Apple Pay, and Google Wallet, accept virtually all forms of payment. In retail stores, the mobile POS system helps in attaining consumer data, empowering employees, and generating more dynamic sales opportunities.</p>
