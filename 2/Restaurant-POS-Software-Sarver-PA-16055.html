<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>
<p>When you've got the basics of good inventory management and great customer service in place, you can devote mental energy to creating an immersive, interactive experience in your stores. Vend POS is one the most flexible Retail POS Systems on the market, boasting third-party add-ons galore and compatibility with many operating systems. Now the systems that process checks and credit cards are an integral part of many POS systems.</p>

<p>Retailers have the ability to implement special promotions or establish customer loyalty programs to encourage customers to purchase popular items. This will include hardware components like credit card readers, touchscreen monitors, receipt printers, and barcode scanners. Traditional card machines require software installation (if not included) and SIM card or landline cable, while app-based card readers use WiFi or network data from a connected mobile device.</p>
<p>As the need for a more efficient and highly secure payment process is ever increasing, POS systems are an important asset to the success of any retail business. If you're currently using Shopify to sell online, then using Shopify POS for in-store transactions is a no-brainer.

<p>Thus came the CRM software into the picture, and over time, evolved into a robust customer management platform. From full service establishments to quick service franchises we have matched hundreds of independent restauranteurs throughout the country with the POS system they need to realize lasting success in a highly competitive industry. Point of sale (POS), a critical piece of a point of purchase , refers to the place where a customer executes the payment for goods or services and where sales taxes may become payable.</p>
<p>Therefore, the need for a smarter way of calculating sales tax for bar sales. Many a times the users might prefer to make partial payments- some by using Gift card (GC) and remaining by Cash.

I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc.</p>
