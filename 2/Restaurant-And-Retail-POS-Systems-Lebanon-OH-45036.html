<p>By making customer experience a central focus, retailers can transform their businesses to deliver unified, personalized customer experiences in-store, online, on the go and on a mobile or tablet device. The best POS vendors provide reliable customer support that you can contact around the clock, so even if your business keeps irregular hours or you're working late, you can receive help when you need it.
