<p>For any restaurant, point of sale technology is important. What Imonggo's free plan doesn't offer is broad integration capabilities, offline access, or the option to accept credit card payments. Once you've come up with a shortlist of potential POS systems, check out what businesses like yours are saying about them. With core functionalities built around inventory management, ecommerce, analytics, and customer loyalty, it helps you boost product management as well as track and organize customer data.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>

More sophisticated POS software will actually compile data on purchases, customer history (so that big spenders can get premiere treatment), what items are moving well and what items stay stagnant.
