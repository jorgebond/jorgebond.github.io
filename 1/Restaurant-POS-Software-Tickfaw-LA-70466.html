<p>PointOS was founded by bar and restaurant professionals to provide a cost effective, full-featured and user-friendly restaurant management platform that helps restaurants and bars operate more efficiently and profitably. This free POS software can perform all of the common register functions, track up to 13,000 SKU's, monitor sales of up to 56 employees, and handle daily sales reporting.
