<p>Point of Sale (POS) Systems have now become the business management choice for most retailers when managing their day-to-day business activities. For a store that generates annual sales, the savings can be significant by utilising a POS system. Plus, with constant staff turnaround in restaurants, an easy-to-use POS minimizes training time for getting new employees on the floor. Omnichannel by design: Manhattan POS is equipped with all of the capabilities needed to turn stores into the center of your omnichannel experience: omni cart, omni fulfillment, returns, exchanges, cross-channel promotions, complete customer transaction and interaction history across channels, and more.</p>

Mobile apps have turned phones into portable payment kiosks, minimizing hardware requirements, while enabling retailers to take the transaction from the counter to the sales floor and beyond. Point of sale represents the area where retail businesses conduct their most intensive data entry.</p>
