<p>POS is a short form for point of sale. Users can utilize numerous features for managing customer information, dashboards and reports, promotions and pricing, main product catalog, orders, inventory, and cash. However, a POS terminal is the electronic equipment performing the sales transaction and processing the credit card payments. Lightspeed users can also consult the Lightspeed Community to discuss their POS system with other retailers, restaurateurs and Lightspeed experts.</p>

<p>Not only this, by using an efficient restaurant management software, you can avoid any embarrassments and possible loss of business that may be a result of overbooking, double-booking, or lags in customer service. Simply explained, every time your customer purchases your business, they're completing a point of the sale transaction.
