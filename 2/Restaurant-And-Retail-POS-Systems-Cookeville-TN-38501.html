<p>The early days of using a cash register and pen and notebook for accounting and processing transactions are no longer an effective means of keeping up with today's advancements in business technology. POS vendors and retailers are working hard to standardise the technology behind POS systems, to drive down manufacturing and product costs. With open API's, these POS systems can allow integration platforms like DBSync to share the data with various other apps securely, thus avoiding double data entry. From taking orders in a coffee shop, booking hotel rooms, selling event tickets, retail stores, or restaurants.</p>
<p>Thus, a retail owner should take a careful matching of POS softwares and hardwares. It's our fastest reader ever - processing payments in seconds - and it's easy to integrate with our POS software. You should choose cloud-based bar POS software that enables order taking, payment processing, employee management, inventory tracking, data recording and real-time reporting. If you're in need of a POS that has great robust inventory management built in to it then I suggest you give the Hike a test and consider it.</p>

Most POS systems for bars and restaurants will have this feature.</p>
<p>And many POS systems are capable of accepting almost any type of payment, including contactless payments like Apple Pay and Google Pay. That kind of (costly) frustration can't occur in retail stores. Ultimately, inventory is synchronized with less human error that is simply getting you real-time data and result for your business. Without a POS System, your customers will have to stand in a long line to wait for their checkout turn.</p>
