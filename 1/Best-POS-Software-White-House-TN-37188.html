<p>Point of sale (POS) can be referred to as a check-out or cash wrap and is usually the location in a store or restaurant where transactions for the exchange goods and services occur. Some retailers choose to operate an RMS by assembling the various pieces from different software vendors: a POS system from Vendor A, an inventory management system from Vendor B, purchasing management from Vendor C, a business intelligence tool from Vendor D, an ecommerce system from Vendor E and so on. The costs of implementing multiple disparate systems and getting them to work together in harmony is prohibitive for all but the largest retail businesses.</p>

<p>Over the last few years, there have been several advancements in restaurant POS Before we look at how the restaurant point of sale system has evolved over the years, let us first define what exactly is a point of sale system.

The cash only retail business is quickly fading into obscurity.</p>
