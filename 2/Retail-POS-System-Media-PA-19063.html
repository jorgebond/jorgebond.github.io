<p>The "point of sale" in any retail store, restaurant, grocery store, and so on refers to the location where transactions typically occur (i.e. check-out).

<p>Toast's integrated CRM software can help you build an inventory of loyal customers and craft messages and promotions to keep your guests happy and your business profitable. The bottom line: A good restaurant POS centralizes all the processes of a restaurant, bar or cafe, allowing the manager to improve on what's working and fix what's not.
