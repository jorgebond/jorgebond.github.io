Connect with your customers: for those of you using a Yelp business user account, connect with all your customers and get their reviews to improve your business. Another factor that determines how much you'll pay for hardware is whether you use a legacy terminal or a mobile POS system. A right POS should also keep track of inventory at other branches and provide continuous insights on product sales.</p>
