<h3>Top POS Systems For Restaurants To Use Hugo Minnesota</h3>

In addition to a full setup with an iPad stand, receipt printer and cash drawer, it offers a mobile POS option for accepting payments at the table. You can accept payment right in the online invoice, and customers can pay by credit card, Apple Pay, free ACH bank transfer, or over the phone.</p>
<p>Harbortouch TablesideTM allows your restaurant's servers to input customer orders directly from the table via an Apple® iPad® for a dramatic increase in speed, service quality, and efficiency. Each time an item is ordered through the POS it is removed from the current inventory. Increase your sales and profitability by expanding your bar and alcohol business.
