<p>The Point of Sale system from QuickBooks has always captured the attention and curiosity of many people. Swipe your customer's card and open a bar tab quickly. Cova is the perfect POS system for cannabis retailers. Select from complete solutions featuring QuickStore software and a Cash Drawer, Pole Display, Receipt Printer and Barcode Scanner. The order management system features an activity dashboard that provides weekly or monthly sales reports for stock managers. It's also complete with features such as financial data analysis, inventory management, customer loyalty programs, payment gateways, delivery management, and currency exchange.</p>
<p>With the bar tab feature, pre-authorize credit cards so collecting payment is a breeze, and feel at ease because you won't be responsible for a stack of credit cards sitting behind the bar any longer. Likewise, gift and loyalty programs—whether for retail or hospitality customers —can turn payment into a personalized guest experience in which you reward customers, run targeted promotions, and gather key data on preferences and behaviors.</p>
