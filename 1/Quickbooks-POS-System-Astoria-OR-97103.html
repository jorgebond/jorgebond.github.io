<p>Retail point of sale (POS) applications constantly battle adult age verification. Not only do we offer a fully featured PMS for Hostels, but we also provide a highly configurable and feature rich POS solution, with the option of full inventory management. Interactive graphs help managers understand the data collected in the software system's reporting and analytics features. Those are all available features in POS systems. The next consideration is an inventory management system, since keeping control of stock is a time-consuming job.</p>
<p>Gone are those days when retailers used a cash register to process sales after which the data was transferred to accounts and stock list. It's a proven fact that when customers open bar tabs, they spend more. Whether you have single or multiple stores, our tools help run your business. A decent POS computer system provides features to manage a large company database, that can be conceivably shared amongst multiple store locations.</p>

<p>Some bars even implement mobile POS systems at tables, which allow customers to order, pay and perform other collective actions, without having to attract the attention of the staff. Its rich features with no hidden fees make it lucrative for many small businesses. EPOS has a lot of very specific configuration options, perfectly suited for cafe, restaurant, and bar owners. From its start as part of an initial purchase order, to its receipt in the store or warehouse, as it is transferred between locations, when it is counted and re-counted - and eventually as part of a sale from the POS.</p>

<p>POS software is the technology used in tandem with point of sale hardware—such as a card reader mounted to a smartphone—to process and monitor sales, track inventory, store customer data, integrate with systems and databases, and a variety of other functions.

<p>You can choose your own credit card processor to cut the best possible deal. With regards to databases, POS systems are very demanding on their performance because of numerous submissions and retrievals of data - required for correct sequencing the receipt number, checking up on various discounts, membership, calculating subtotal, so forth - just to process a single sale transaction. By implementing this solution in your bar or nightclub you will be in a better position to overcome the chaos that is commonly associated with the rush in the business.</p>
<p>For store-owners in any business, it is important to maintain a cash counter for payment purposes. For retail stores, winning shoppers' loyalty is accomplished when their needs are met and their shopping experience leaves them satisfied that they received quality products at competitive prices and great customer service. However, to take advantage of all of Rezku's features, large restaurants get more for their investment.</p>
