<p>Retail point of sale (POS) applications constantly battle adult age verification. Not only do we offer a fully featured PMS for Hostels, but we also provide a highly configurable and feature rich POS solution, with the option of full inventory management. Interactive graphs help managers understand the data collected in the software system's reporting and analytics features. Those are all available features in POS systems. The next consideration is an inventory management system, since keeping control of stock is a time-consuming job.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
