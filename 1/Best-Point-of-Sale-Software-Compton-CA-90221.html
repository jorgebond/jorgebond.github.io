<p>Point of sale equipment is an essential tool required for the management of a business' day to day operations. A POS system has features that support the rationalization of a small or large retail business's day to day operations. Runs in Offline Mode: Even when you are offline, you can punch in orders and download business reports with LimeTray restaurant software. However, POS software is quite scalable and modules can be added for accounting, inventory and even customer relationship management (CRM.) Value priced software choices are available that can give a small shop owner some of the tools the large fortune 500 retailers use.</p>
<p>POS systems let retailers track their inventory across multiple stores in different locations. These options may also encourage your customers to spend more money at your business. You can connect the POS system with most-used business applications and payment systems, like Paypal, Xero, and Quickbooks. In addition to helping owners and operators detect theft through detailed sales and inventory reporting, some bar and nightclub POS systems also offer cash drawer management to further protect against employee theft.</p>
