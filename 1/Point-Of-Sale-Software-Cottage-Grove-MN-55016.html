<p>A gift shop needs specialist POS software if the business is to reach its full potential. For example, you could ask customers questions such as "do you ever shop with us online?" or "would you be interested in a frequent shopper program?" Also, keep in mind that even if there are software packages designed specifically for your type of business, they may vary wildly and you still need to research the features to determine what'll work best for your business. Think of a POS system as the convergence point where a customer and a business make a deal.</p>

Traverse POS Software uses a distributed design that does not require a constant connection to the primary server and database, bringing you the stability and flexibility you need for high-volume business.

POS systems are increasingly interactive, particularly in the hospitality industry, and allow customers to place orders and reservations and pay bills electronically.</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of restaurant POS software is the inclusion of a cash drawer (and potentially an iPad) to be used either at the counter or tableside. Make notes about customers to remember each client's personal preferences and to provide the best service. ETP has successfully executed over 500 enterprise software projects across 35,000+ stores for 300+ brands.

<p>It is a must in retail stores earning revenue above $7, 00,000. Nightclub or bar POS software with preauthorization will also immediately tokenize and encrypt customer credit card information when it's swiped, so no sensitive information is stored on the device. While a cash register only stores money and is often attached to a computer or bar code scanner a point of sale or POS does this all in one interface.</p>
<p>Any form of payment can be used, such as cash, debit cards, credit cards, mobile payments, and even accumulated loyalty points. If you're currently using Shopify to sell online, or plan to expand your retail stores into the ecommerce space, then I highly recommend the Shopify POS system.
