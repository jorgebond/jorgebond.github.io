<p>Reward vouchers printed at point of sale can help keep diners and drinkers loyal. Manage your restaurant with inventory management, employee management, and live sales figures.

<h2>Retail Point Of Sale, POS Systems & Software Brookfield</h2>
<p>It fulfills all our requirements and fits our budget, way more than I expected from a restaurant POS software. When determining how much a bar POS system will cost your business, you must first decide if you are going to lease or purchase your hardware. If you are operating a small or midsize bar, cloud-based POS software is likely the best option for your business. And with QuickBooks hardware and software, you can take any type of payment from just about any device—barcode scanner, touch screen terminal, iPad, or mobile reader.</p>
<p>In short, a mobile POS system enhances a bar's ability to service customers quickly. Lightspeed Retail ( see our review ) was created back in 2005 and is now used by more than 50,000 businesses around the world.

PAR Technology provides cloud-based POS systems to some of the country's most popular restaurant chains, including McDonald's, Subway, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut.</p>
