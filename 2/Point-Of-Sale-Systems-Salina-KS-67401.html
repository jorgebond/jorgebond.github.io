<p>It is known that some of the most enterprising, enthusiastic and energetic people reside in the U.S. So it doesn't come as a surprise that many individuals of the U.S. invest their savings, hoping that with the returns, they will be in a position to commence a small but lucrative business. Some point of sale vendors refer to their POS system as "retail management system" which is actually a more appropriate term given that this software is no longer just about processing sales but comes with many other capabilities such as inventory management, membership system, supplier record, bookkeeping, issuing of purchase orders, quotations and stock transfers, hide barcode label creation, sale reporting and in some cases remote outlets networking or linkage, to name some major ones.</p>
<p>Cashier Live works for all retail stores, but it has special features for boutiques, hardware stores and pharmacies. The scheduler is an online booking tool that allows your customers to book appointments for services when they purchase their Groupon deal. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location.</p>

Menu management lets you switch between different menus for different parts of the day, such as happy hour. Usually, this is an automated process which is scheduled to run at a certain time interval in real stores.</p>
<p>Inventory isn't a favorite topic among managers, but it's a top necessity for being ahead in a highly competitive business. A POS system is computer software and hardware networked together to track sales and inventory as they occur. Key features include floor management, customer and inventory tracking, table-side ordering and an offline mode. Retailers who meet this requirement first will build stronger relationships with customers, create space for innovation projects, and make more strategic decisions that maximize their growth.</p>
