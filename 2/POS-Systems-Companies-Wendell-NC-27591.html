By supporting every possible customer path through the retailer's ecosystem with consistent approaches to promotions, customer returns and exchanges, earning and redemption of loyalty rewards, use of gift cards and digital passes (electronic coupons), iVend POS ensures the most uniform consumer experience, irrespective of how your customers shop. So in order to accelerate the process developed software together with an improved hardware will improve the quality of service and increase the level of customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed. While its Square Point of Sale App is an all-in-one software for pretty much any business, Square for Restaurants is rather an optimized version with the specific features that restaurant business owners need.

Our POS software is designed to suit a range of hospitality business types, from cafes and restaurants and bars to multi-site restaurant groups and national service organisations.

You will likely face product and customer caps with free POS software.
