<p>Onetap is hospitality point of sale, stock control, customer loyalty, reporting and integrated software using smart technology for restaurants, cafes, bars and more. You also get dashboards, retail, and product report to gain insights into your store's growth and sales performance. If you already own a PC you can "create" a POS by purchasing the POS software and adding the peripherals you will need such as a cash drawer, credit card swiper, etc. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.</p>

<h2>How To Choose The Best POS System For Your Bar Fullerton</h2>

Why thousands of business owners worldwide choose onetap over the many other hospitality POS systems out there.</p>

<h3>Best Point Of Sale (POS) Software Fullerton California</h3>
<p>Traditionally, POS systems were on-premise, which means they used an on-site server and could only run in a specific area of your store. In addition to a full setup with an iPad stand, receipt printer and cash drawer, it offers a mobile POS option for accepting payments at the table. You can accept payment right in the online invoice, and customers can pay by credit card, Apple Pay, free ACH bank transfer, or over the phone.</p>
<p>Integrated CRM performance within our retail pos system catches significant customers information and facts like buying selection and purchasing history, which usually allows long term cross-sell as well as up-sell possibilities with regard to multi-channel selling. The benefits of this system include reduced overhead for staffing, and also from reduced time that the customer must wait for checkout. This is the best option for those looking to expand their businesses- i.e. if you're looking to open and run two or more physical retail stores.</p>
