A restaurant POS solution is primarily defined by organizing orders by table, making it easy for the server to send customer orders to the kitchen. We've listed the most common hardware used by the retailer, but keep in mind that not every business needs all of these products.</p>
<p>You can start small with a simple credit card reader, then transition to a Square terminal, tablet stand or register as your business grows.

A vital element of POS hardware is the cash drawer. Payment is easy - at the beginning of the night, servers can start a tab in the POS for each customer, adding their name and payment card information so they don't have to ask again, allowing customers more convenience when they spend an evening in your bar.</p>

<p>Even if the workers are not physically present to manage the sales process, then also the users can run their business with the help of this POS system.
