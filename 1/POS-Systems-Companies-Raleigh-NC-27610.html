<p>And you can track staff schedules, productivity, sales activity, and more. Customers will appreciate the attention and will be encouraged to return to the business. Apt for - ticket sales, large retail stores, parking, human resources. A point-of-sale (POS) system is more than a fancy cash register. In-person customers will be well-served through the service, which includes contactless payment in its hardware options.</p>
<p>Our POS comes standard with features which will improve your entire business, without the hidden cost. Your POS may be able to take some of the more tedious or time-consuming parts of owning a small business off your hands, dramatically improving your efficiency. The best restaurant POS systems are so much more than order and till systems. As is based on the same platform as our Hostel PMS, the two systems are totally integrated - and all revenue postings from the POS are pushed to the PMS (regardless of folio charge or cash payment data).</p>
<p>Marks and Spencer, a UK based retailer dealing in fashion and apparel, uses more than 16000 POS applications in its stores world wide.

Our POS software is designed to suit a range of hospitality business types, from cafes and restaurants and bars to multi-site restaurant groups and national service organisations. But, using a POS that is tailored to retail isn't wise because a restaurant is a completely different business with different needs.</p>
<p>Lightspeed Restaurant is another reliable POS system that streamlines the hospitality experience for both venue managers and their clients. The most common feedback KORONA gets from new customers is that they have never used a retail point of sale system that is faster.
